## Positioning Strategy

### Core Messaging

**You are not:**
* A generic AI governance consultant
* A compliance officer without clinical experience
* A tech vendor selling enterprise software

**You are:**
* A respiratory therapist who understands bedside workflow
* Someone building solutions to real clinical governance gaps
* An insider with technical capability

**Your credibility comes from:**
* Lived experience with alarm fatigue
* Understanding of vent protocols and sepsis bundles
* Knowing how AI actually lands in care (not just theory)

## Post Series: Building Authority

### Post 1: The Problem (Pain Recognition)

**Goal:** Establish that you understand the problem better than outsiders

**Draft:**

```
I've been thinking about AI governance in healthcare.

Not from a compliance office.
From bedside.

When an AI system recommends changing vent settings, three things happen:

1. The RT looks at the recommendation
2. The RT uses clinical judgment
3. The RT documents the decision

But here's what doesn't happen:

There's no tamper-evident record that the AI followed approved protocols.

If a lawyer asks 6 months later: "Prove this AI recommendation was within your institution's guidelines" — what do you show them?

Database logs? Those can be modified.
EHR audit trails? They show the action, not the governance.

This is a gap I can't stop thinking about.

#HealthcareAI #RespiratoryTherapy #ClinicalInformatics
```

**Why this works:**
* Shows lived experience (bedside, not boardroom)
* Identifies a specific, credible problem
* Doesn't sell anything
* Invites engagement from people with the same pain

---

### Post 2: The Solution Concept (Introduce Decision Certificates)

**Goal:** Introduce Clinical Decision Integrity Certificates as the answer

**Draft:**

```
What if every AI-assisted clinical decision had a birth certificate?

Not a log entry.
Not an audit trail.
A cryptographically signed certificate that proves:

1. The AI followed approved protocols
2. Human oversight was documented
3. The decision chain is tamper-evident
4. It can be verified offline by auditors

I call these "Clinical Decision Integrity Certificates."

They're built using the same cryptographic techniques as digital signatures, but designed for healthcare AI governance.

Example: Sepsis prediction alert

- Certificate ID: 01JC3X7...
- Timestamp: 2026-03-15T14:32:10Z
- Model version: sepsis-predictor-v2
- Policy check: approved
- Human override: false
- Signature: Valid ✓

If the database is compromised, the certificate still verifies.
If the company shuts down, the certificate still verifies.
If a lawyer asks for proof, the certificate provides it.

This is what I'm building for respiratory and critical care AI workflows.

Thoughts? Is this solving a real problem, or am I overthinking it?

#HealthcareAI #AIGovernance #DigitalHealth #RespiratoryTherapy
```

**Why this works:**
* Concrete example (sepsis alert)
* Clear benefit (tamper-evident, offline verifiable)
* Asks for feedback (invites engagement)
* Positions you as builder, not consultant

---

### Post 3: The Insight Question (Surface Pain from Others)

**Goal:** Get healthcare IT leaders and compliance officers to engage

**Draft:**

```
Quick question for healthcare IT and compliance teams:

When a regulatory auditor asks:

"Prove this AI recommendation followed your approved clinical protocols at the time it executed"

...what artifact do you provide?

I'm specifically curious about:

- Sepsis prediction systems
- Ventilator decision support
- Clinical documentation AI
- Prior authorization automation

Do you have:
✓ Tamper-evident proof of governance?
✓ Offline verification capability?
✓ Cryptographic audit trail?

Or are you relying on:
⚠️ Database logs (modifiable)
⚠️ EHR audit trails (show action, not governance)
⚠️ Vendor black boxes (no verification)

This isn't a sales pitch. I'm genuinely trying to understand the current state of AI governance in clinical workflows.

What am I missing? What's working well for you?

#HealthcareCompliance #ClinicalAI #AIGovernance #HealthIT
```

**Why this works:**
* Direct question (easy to answer)
* No selling (explicitly stated)
* Surfaces specific pain points
* Invites professionals with purchasing authority to engage

### Post 4: Regulatory Hook (Connect to EU AI Act / FDA)

**Goal:** Position certificates as regulatory solution

**Draft:**

```
EU AI Act classifies medical AI as "high-risk."

Article 11 requires "technical documentation" for every decision.
Article 13 requires "human oversight" be demonstrable.
Article 14 requires evidence that humans could intervene.

FDA's Software as a Medical Device guidance requires:
- Algorithm version tracking
- Change management documentation
- Performance monitoring

SOC 2 audits require:
- Separation of duties in policy changes
- Tamper-evident audit logs

HIPAA requires:
- Activity logging with integrity controls

Here's my question:

When you deploy an AI sepsis predictor or ventilator advisor...

What single artifact satisfies all of these requirements?

Most healthcare organizations are using:
- Database logs (modifiable)
- EHR audit trails (incomplete governance proof)
- Vendor dashboards (trust-dependent)

None of these provide cryptographically verifiable proof that governance executed before the AI recommendation.

That's why I'm building Clinical Decision Integrity Certificates.

Tamper-evident.
Offline verifiable.
Regulatory defensible.

Built for respiratory and critical care workflows, designed to scale to other clinical AI.

Is this something you'd want to pilot in your organization?

#EUAIAct #FDAregulation #HealthcareCompliance #AIGovernance
```

**Why this works:**
* Cites specific regulations (shows research)
* Identifies gap in current approaches
* Positions certificates as solution
* Calls to action (pilot interest)

### Post 5: From Bedside to Builder (Personal Story)

**Goal:** Humanize the technical project, build authenticity

**Draft:**

```
I didn't expect to end up building AI governance infrastructure.

I'm a respiratory therapist.

But when you're at the bedside during a rapid response, you see things:

- Alarm fatigue (so many false alerts that real ones get missed)
- Protocol drift (every shift does weaning slightly differently)
- Documentation burden (30% of RT time is charting)
- Tech promises vs. reality (AI that doesn't understand workflow)

So when AI started entering critical care — sepsis predictors, vent advisors, auto-charting — I had one big question:

"How do we prove this AI is following our protocols?"

Not in theory. In court. In an audit. When a regulator asks.

I looked for a solution. Didn't find one.

So I started building.

The result: Clinical Decision Integrity Certificates.

Every AI-assisted decision gets a cryptographically signed, tamper-evident certificate that proves:
- The AI followed approved protocols
- Human oversight happened
- The decision chain can be verified offline

Starting narrow: respiratory care workflows (sepsis, vent weaning, ABG interpretation).

Not because governance is only needed there.
Because that's where I can speak with credibility.

If you're deploying clinical AI and wondering how to prove governance executed...

Let's talk.

This problem is too important to solve alone.

* Personal narrative (authentic, relatable)
* Shows insider perspective
* Positions technical work as clinical necessity
* Invites collaboration
