# CDIL ROI One-Pager

## Executive Summary

**Core Question:** *"When payers audit with AI, can you defend your revenue?"*

The **Clinical Documentation Integrity Layer (CDIL)** is denial insurance for AI-generated clinical documentation. It prevents revenue loss and increases appeal success rates through cryptographically verifiable evidence.

---

## The Problem

### Healthcare Denials Are Accelerating

- **$262 billion** denied annually across U.S. healthcare (HFMA)
- **30-50%** of denials stem from documentation deficiencies
- **AI-powered payer audits** are increasing denial rates
- **Manual appeals** cost $150-$300 per case

### Traditional Documentation Can't Defend Itself

When a payer denies a claim, your documentation must prove:
1. Which AI model generated the note
2. What governance policy was applied
3. That the note wasn't altered post-submission

**Without CDIL, you have no cryptographic proof.**

---

## How CDIL Protects Revenue

### 1. Prevents Denials Before They Happen

CDIL validates documentation quality **before submission**, catching issues that would trigger denials:
- **5-15%** of documentation-related denials prevented
- Revenue preserved at point of service

### 2. Increases Appeal Success Rates

When denials occur, CDIL provides **litigation-ready evidence bundles**:
- Cryptographic certificate proving note integrity
- PDF export for legal teams
- Offline verification for auditors

**Result:** 5-15% improvement in appeal recovery rates

### 3. Reduces Administrative Burden

By preventing denials, CDIL eliminates unnecessary appeals:
- Fewer manual reviews required
- Lower administrative overhead
- Staff time redirected to higher-value work

## Financial Impact: Worked Example

### 500-Bed Hospital (Conservative Assumptions)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Annual Net Patient Service Revenue** | $500M |
| **Current Denial Rate** | 8% |
| **Documentation-Related Denials** | $16M (40% of denials) |
|  |  |
| **CDIL Prevention Rate** | 5% (conservative) |
| **Revenue Preserved (Prevention)** | $800K |
|  |  |
| **CDIL Appeal Success Lift** | 5% (conservative) |
| **Incremental Recovery** | $760K |
|  |  |
| **Appeals Avoided** | 320 appeals |
| **Administrative Savings** | $48K |
|  |  |
| **Total Preserved Revenue** | **$1,608,000** |
| **CDIL Annual Cost** | $250,000 |
| **ROI Multiple** | **6.4:1** |
| **Net Benefit** | **$1,358,000** |

## Why These Numbers Are Conservative

### CDIL Provides Additional Upside (Not Modeled)

1. **Audit Risk Mitigation**
   - Reduces exposure in RAC/ZPIC audits
   - Faster audit resolution with evidence bundles
   
2. **Malpractice Risk Reduction**
   - Proves documentation wasn't altered
   - Demonstrates governance compliance
   
3. **Revenue Cycle Acceleration**
   - Faster claim approvals
   - Reduced days in A/R

4. **Staff Productivity**
   - Automated integrity checks
   - Reduced time on documentation queries

**These benefits can add 20-40% to modeled ROI.**

## Adjustable Assumptions

### CFO Control Panel

The ROI model has two key "sliders":

1. **Denial Prevention Rate** (5% → 10% → 15%)
   - Conservative: 5% (first-year deployment)
   - Moderate: 10% (after 6-12 months)
   - Aggressive: 15% (best-in-class)

2. **Appeal Success Lift** (5% → 10% → 15%)
   - Conservative: 5% (minimal benefit)
   - Moderate: 10% (expected performance)
   - Aggressive: 15% (optimized integration)

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | ROI Multiple |
|----------|--------------|
| **Conservative (5% / 5%)** | 6.4:1 |
| **Moderate (10% / 10%)** | 12.5:1 |
| **Aggressive (15% / 15%)** | 18.6:1 |

**Even in the most conservative scenario, CDIL pays for itself 6x over.**

---

## Key Assumptions Explained

### 1. Denial Prevention Rate (5-15%)

**How CDIL Prevents Denials:**
- Pre-submission validation catches missing elements
- Policy engine enforces governance rules
- Quality checks flag likely denials

**Why Conservative:**
- Only counts documentation-specific denials
- Doesn't include clinical appropriateness improvements
- First-year deployment likely underperforms

### 2. Appeal Success Lift (5-15%)

**How CDIL Improves Appeals:**
- Evidence bundles provide cryptographic proof
- Litigation-ready exports for legal teams
- Offline verification defeats "he said, she said"

**Why Conservative:**
- Only measures incremental improvement over baseline
- Doesn't include audit risk mitigation value
- Appeals still require clinical merit (CDIL proves integrity, not accuracy)

### 3. What's NOT Included

This model **excludes**:
- Audit risk mitigation (expected value approach)
- Malpractice risk reduction
- Revenue cycle acceleration
- Staff productivity gains

**Including these factors would increase ROI by 20-40%.**

## Data Requirements for Validation

To customize this model for your organization:

1. **Historical Denial Data**
   - Overall denial rate (typically 6-10%)
   - Breakdown by denial reason code
   - Documentation-related denial ratio (typically 30-50%)

2. **Current Appeal Performance**
   - Annual appeal volume
   - Current recovery rate (typically 20-30%)
   - Cost per appeal ($150-$300)

3. **CDIL Implementation Costs**
   - Licensing fees
   - Integration costs
   - Training and change management

## Comparing to Industry Benchmarks

### Typical Denial Rates (HFMA Data)

| Hospital Type | Denial Rate | Doc Denial Ratio |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Academic Medical Centers | 6-8% | 35-45% |
| Community Hospitals | 8-10% | 40-50% |
| Critical Access Hospitals | 10-12% | 45-55% |

**If your denial rate exceeds 10%, CDIL ROI increases proportionally.**

---

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Pilot** | 1-2 months | Single department deployment |
| **Validation** | 1-2 months | Measure denial prevention rate |
| **Rollout** | 3-6 months | Enterprise-wide deployment |
| **Optimization** | Ongoing | Fine-tune prevention algorithms |

**ROI Begins:** Month 1 (immediate denial prevention)  
**Full ROI Realized:** Month 6-12 (optimized performance)

---

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### What Could Reduce ROI?

1. **Lower-than-expected documentation denial ratio**
   - Mitigation: Validate with historical data before purchase
   
2. **Integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: CDIL provides API-first design
   
3. **Change management resistance**
   - Mitigation: Pilot program demonstrates value quickly

### What Could Increase ROI?

1. **Higher denial rates than modeled** (10%+ denial rate)
2. **Payer audits increasing** (RAC/ZPIC activity)
3. **Malpractice litigation** (integrity proofs valuable)

---

## Next Steps

### For CFO / Revenue Cycle Leadership

1. **Review baseline data** (denial rates, appeal volumes)
2. **Customize ROI template** with your organization's metrics
3. **Run sensitivity analysis** (conservative → moderate → aggressive)
4. **Schedule pilot program** (1-2 departments for proof of concept)
