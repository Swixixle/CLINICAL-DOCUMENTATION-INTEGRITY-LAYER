# CDIL for AI Vendors: Trust-as-a-Service

## The Problem

**Hospitals are hesitant to adopt AI without governance proof and liability protection.**

- Procurement committees demand: "How do we prove which model generated what?"
- Legal teams ask: "What if the AI makes an error - can we prove the model version?"
- Compliance officers require: "How do we audit AI usage?"
- Payers challenge: "How do we know this was generated by an approved model?"

**Without CDIL**: You sell software. Hospitals bear all the audit and liability risk. Slow adoption, competitive disadvantage.

## The Solution: Vendor Registry + Attestations

CDIL lets you **register your models** and provide **cryptographic attestations** that your models are being used correctly.

### What You Get

1. **Model Registry**
   - Register model name, version, and metadata
   - Provide public key for vendor attestations
   - Rotate keys without breaking old certificates
   - Track which hospitals use which models

2. **Trust Differentiation**
   - "Our models are certifiable and auditable"
   - Compete on governance, not just accuracy
   - Enable enterprise procurement

3. **Liability Reduction**
   - Prove which model version was used
   - Show governance policy was applied
   - Demonstrate human review requirements
   - Provide evidence for legal defense

## API Integration

### Register Your Vendor & Models

```bash
# 1. Register as vendor (one-time)
POST /v1/vendors/register
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>
Body: {"vendor_name": "Anthropic"}

Response: {"vendor_id": "vendor-abc123"}

# 2. Register your model with public key
POST /v1/vendors/register-model
Body: {
  "vendor_id": "vendor-abc123",
  "model_name": "Claude-3",
  "model_version": "opus-20240229",
  "metadata": {
    "max_tokens": 200000,
    "training_cutoff": "2023-08"
  },
  "public_jwk": {
    "kty": "EC",
    "crv": "P-256",
    "x": "...",
    "y": "..."
  }
}

Response: {
  "model_id": "model-xyz789",
  "key_id": "key-456",
  "status": "active"
}

# 3. Rotate keys when needed
POST /v1/vendors/rotate-model-key
Body: {
  "model_id": "model-xyz789",
  "new_public_jwk": {...}
}
```

### Hospital Approval Workflow

```bash
# Hospital admin approves your model
POST /v1/governance/models/allow
Body: {
  "model_id": "model-xyz789",
  "allow_reason": "Approved by Clinical AI Committee 2026-02-18"
}

# Now certificates can be issued using your model
# Hospital's CDIL tracks: your model_id, version, timestamps
```

## Business Value

### Competitive Differentiation

**Before CDIL**:
- "We have 95% accuracy" (everyone says this)
- "We're HIPAA compliant" (table stakes)
- "Trust us" (not enough for enterprise)

**With CDIL**:
- "We're the only vendor with cryptographic audit trail"
- "Every note includes proof of model version and governance"
- "Hospitals can export evidence for payer appeals"
- "Multi-vendor ecosystems? We support that."

### Enterprise Sales Enablement

**Procurement Objection**: "How do we audit AI usage?"

**Your Response with CDIL**:
- "Every note gets a certificate with our model ID"
- "You can query: which models, which versions, which dates"
- "You can export evidence bundles for compliance audits"
- "You control which of our models are approved"

**Procurement Objection**: "What about liability?"

**Your Response with CDIL**:
- "Certificates prove which model version generated each note"
- "Governance policy is cryptographically bound to certificate"
- "Human review status is tamper-evident"
- "You have evidence for legal defense"

### Partnership Opportunities

**Multi-Vendor Ecosystem**:
- Hospital uses your model for oncology notes
- Competitor for cardiology notes
- Different vendor for radiology reports
- CDIL tracks all of them with unified governance

**Your Advantage**: 
- "We support CDIL - competitor doesn't"
- "We enable your multi-vendor strategy"
- "We don't force vendor lock-in"

## Technical Integration

### Minimal Changes Required

**Your API**:
```python
# When generating note, include model metadata
response = your_ai_api.generate_note(prompt)

# Hospital's CDIL integration
certificate = cdil.issue_certificate(
    note_text=response.text,
    model_id="model-xyz789",  # Your registered model ID
    model_version="opus-20240229",
    human_reviewed=True
)
```

### Key Rotation

**Scenario**: Security incident requires key rotation

```bash
# You rotate your key
POST /v1/vendors/rotate-model-key

# Old certificates still verify (old key preserved)
# New certificates use new key
# No hospital downtime
```

## ROI for AI Vendors

### Faster Enterprise Adoption

- **Without CDIL**: 6-12 month procurement cycle
  - Legal review of liability terms
  - Compliance audit of governance claims
  - Pilot, then slow rollout

- **With CDIL**: 3-6 month procurement cycle
  - Governance proof baked in
  - Liability terms clearer (model version tracking)
  - Faster pilot-to-production

**Value**: 2x faster enterprise sales velocity

### Higher Win Rates

- **Competitive RFP**: "Must support auditable AI governance"
  - You: "We integrate with CDIL for cryptographic audit trail"
  - Competitor: "We have a governance policy document" (loses)

**Value**: 10-20% higher win rate on enterprise deals

### Premium Pricing

- **Basic AI**: $50/user/month (commodity)
- **CDIL-Integrated AI**: $75/user/month (differentiated)
- **Justification**: Audit trail, liability reduction, evidence export

**Value**: 50% premium on governance-conscious customers

## Security & Compliance

### What CDIL Tracks
- ✅ Model ID and version
- ✅ Governance policy applied
- ✅ Human review status
- ✅ Timestamps (finalization, EHR commit)

### What CDIL Does NOT Track
- ❌ Model weights or training data
- ❌ Prompts or API calls
- ❌ Plaintext note content (only hashes)
- ❌ Patient identifiers (only hashes)

### Your IP is Protected
- No model reverse-engineering possible
- Only attestations of "this model was used"
- Your training data never leaves your infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Review** - Review [INTEGRITY_ARTIFACT_SPEC.md](../INTEGRITY_ARTIFACT_SPEC.md)
2. **Sandbox Access** - Test vendor registration in dev environment
3. **Partnership Discussion** - Volume pricing for multi-model registration
4. **Joint Go-to-Market** - Co-marketing with hospital customer references

## Questions?

**"Do we have to use CDIL?"**  
No. But hospitals with CDIL ask: "Is your model registered?" If not, they can't approve it.

**"What if we have multiple model versions?"**  
Register each version. Hospitals control which versions are approved.

**"Can competitors see our model metadata?"**  
No. Tenant isolation. Hospital A can't see Hospital B's approved models.

**"What about our proprietary algorithms?"**  
CDIL never accesses your model. It only attests "model X was used". Your IP is protected.

**"How much does this cost?"**  
Vendor registration is free. Volume pricing for enterprise hospitals using your models.
